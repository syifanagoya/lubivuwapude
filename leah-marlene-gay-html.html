However, on Reddit, it is a little different.&nbsp;In a Reddit thread about the singer’s Instagram Live from three months ago, it seems she had talked a little about her sexuality.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>A Redditor asked if anyone had recorded Marlene’s Live and claimed that she had only watched a little of the end of her IG Live.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>“I was wondering if anyone recorded the whole thing. I’ve always thought she was a little fruity, so hearing that she kinda came out on the Live makes me really wanna watch it because I am a queer girl as well,” said the user.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Although none of the other Redditors had the video, one user by the username Blinkz__ gave a recap of everything Marlene touched on.</p><p>“I don’t have a recording, but she only mentioned it for a minute. Basically, said she is attracted to girls, but she kinda goes with the flow and doesn’t completely rule out a guy relationship, but she hasn’t had an instance where it has happened,” replied the user.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>If her IG Live statements are anything to go by, it looks like Marlene is bisexual.&nbsp;They also added that the singer said she and Fritz Hager were like siblings.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Leah Marlene and Fritz Hager</h2><p>For those out of the loop, during her stint on American Idol, Marlene formed a close bond&nbsp;with Fitz Hager, her fellow co-contestant on the show.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Former American Idol contestants Leah Marlene and Fritz Hager.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Hager made it to the top five before he was eliminated. Hager and Marlene often duetted on the show, leading fans to ship them and causing&nbsp;dating rumors.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>But during an interview with <a href=# rel="follow noopener">HollywoodLife</a>, Hager clarified that he and the 'Wisher to the Well' singer were best friends.&nbsp;</p><p>“Honestly, for me and Leah, they’re [dating rumors] just so funny. It cracks us up because it’s just so not that. But she’s great. She’s like my best friend, but I think people want us to date,” Hager said.&nbsp;</p><p>He added that every time either of them went live or posted something on Instagram, there were always people who asked the dating question. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And as best friends, Hager shared that fans could expect more content from them and that there would be plenty of collaboration between the two.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKSVlrVuucCro56mlWK0osWNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
