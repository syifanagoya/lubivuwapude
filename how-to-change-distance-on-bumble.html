With <b>the</b> search <b>distance</b> option removed, there is no way you can expand <b>the</b> search within <b>the</b> app. In essence, using <b>a</b> third-party app to <b>change the</b> location is <b>your</b> only way out.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-bumble-have-a-distance-setting></span>Does Bumble have a distance setting?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The company announced that people can now expand their <b>distance</b> filters to match with anyone in their country. The app previously only allowed people to connect with someone within a 100-mile range. To change this, look for “nationwide” in your app <b>settings</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-expand-your-location-on-bumble></span>How do you expand your location on Bumble?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Setting your new <b>location</b> for <b>Bumble</b> (and any other GPS-enabled app) is easy.<p><b>Android</b></p><li class=TrT0Xe>Open the Settings menu on your phone.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Tap System.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Tap About Phone.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Tap Software Info.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Tap Build Number 7 times quickly.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Enter your phone’s lock code when prompted.</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-does-distance-work-on-bumble></span>How does distance work on Bumble?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Bumble</b> is showing you the <b>distance</b> of the profile from the LAST time that they logged in. So, if there out and about and decide to see what’s been happening on their profile, wherever they are , at the location <b>Bumble</b> automatically updates to that location. But, only if you log in when you are out of current location.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-guys-on-bumble-see-when-you-look-at-their-profile></span>Can guys on Bumble see when you look at their profile?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Literally, the answer has to be ‘no’ unfortunately. <b>Bumble</b> officially doesn’t allow such things. It used to allow users to <b>see</b> when someone <b>you</b> have matched used the app for the last time. Not just ‘<b>Bumble</b>‘ though; all the swipe-based apps often don’t provide such privileges straightaway to the users.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-bumble-track-your-location></span>Does Bumble track your location?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>When you <b>do</b> go online again and open <b>Bumble</b>, the app will take its information from <b>your</b> Wi-Fi info and <b>your</b> phone’s GPS data. This fact means that <b>Bumble</b> will always set <b>your location</b> based on where you are physically <b>located</b> when using the app.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-bumble-update-your-location-if-you-dont-open-it></span>Does Bumble update your location if you don’t open it?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>It only updates <b>your current location when you</b> are online or <b>when</b> someone sends <b>you</b> a message. So <b>if you don’t open your</b> app during a road trip, and nobody swipes right on <b>your</b> profile, or write to <b>you</b> during that time (so sad!), <b>Bumble</b> will not <b>update your location</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-tell-when-someone-was-last-active-on-bumble></span>Can you tell when someone was last active on Bumble?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The brief answer is “no”. <b>Bumble</b> used to let <b>you see when someone you</b>‘d matched with <b>last</b> used the app. This is because, on <b>Bumble</b> and other swipe-based sites, the “<b>last active</b>” data ended up contributing to some stalking-type behavior.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-change-my-location-on-bumble-without-paying></span>How do I change my location on Bumble without paying?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Unfortunately, <b>Bumble</b> does not allow you to configure a <b>location</b> through settings or <b>your</b> profile. Instead, you have to game the system a bit. The easiest way to <b>change your location</b> in <b>Bumble</b> is to leave geolocation enabled, travel to where you want to appear and turn off geolocation.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-i-hide-my-location-on-bumble></span>Can I hide my location on Bumble?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Can</b> You <b>Hide Location On Bumble</b>. You <b>can</b>‘t <b>hide</b> your <b>location on Bumble</b> once it’s located on the app. ‘Your <b>location</b> will be automatically established by your phone’s GPS and cannot be set manually.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-is-my-location-wrong-on-bumble></span>Why is my location wrong on Bumble?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Your <b>location</b> should be automatically determined by your Internet browser. If your <b>location</b> is <b>incorrect</b>, please make sure that you grant permission for your browser to access your <b>location</b>. Click the icon and your <b>location</b> will update to the latest city pinged by your browser.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-fake-a-location-on-bumble></span>How do you fake a location on Bumble?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-change-my-location-on-bumble-2021></span>How do I change my location on bumble 2021?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Once you locate the app, click on “Install”. Step 4: Once the app is installed on the device, go back to Settings > Developer Options again to select the app under “Mock <b>Location</b> App Feature”. Now you will be able to open the Fake GPS app and <b>change</b> your <b>location</b> to any desired <b>location</b> on the world.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-bumble-tell-you-when-someone-screenshots-a-picture></span>Does Bumble tell you when someone screenshots a picture?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Bumble does</b> not <b>notify</b> the other user when a <b>screenshot</b> is taken. This is great news for <b>you</b> and <b>you can</b> share that funny conversation with your friend. Hold on a minute though, this probably means that your match has also captured <b>screenshots</b> of things that <b>you</b> said.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-bumble-in-a-different-city></span>Can you bumble in a different city?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>With some of our available <b>Bumble</b> subscriptions, <b>you can</b> activate Travel Mode to swipe and be shown in <b>another city</b> before or during your travels making it more convenient to create genuine connections!<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-travel-mode-on-bumble></span>What is travel mode on Bumble?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>With <b>Bumble’s Travel</b> feature, you can change your location to another city before or during your <b>trip</b> — and let locals know you’re just in town for a short stretch. To use the feature, first select “<b>Travel</b> to…” in your settings. It costs five <b>Bumble</b> Coins — the currency within the <b>Bumble</b> app — for seven days.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-does-bumble-show-location-but-not-distance></span>Why does Bumble Show location but not distance?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>If the user is out of their <b>location</b> range, the app will <b>show</b> a <b>distance but</b> rather nothing to the user. If they’ve gone inactive, <b>but</b> you have matched with them, there is a good chance their <b>location</b> may <b>not</b> be there. <b>Bumble</b> will <b>do</b> this because they don’t want to serve inactive profiles to other users.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-go-ghost-mode-on-bumble></span>Can you go ghost mode on Bumble?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Go</b> to your Settings, and right at the very top <b>you</b>‘ll spot “Snooze <b>mode</b>.” Once <b>you</b>‘ve tapped, <b>you</b>‘ll be given four options about the duration of your invisibility on the app. <b>You can</b> choose to be “<b>invisible</b>” for 24 hours, 72 hours, a week, or indefinitely.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46hprBlpKR6pLTAp56eZZSewLWtzZycZqeeYq%2B2ucGlnGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
