The R&B singer attempted a daring kick-jump at the Billboard Music Awards on Sunday, May 19, and ended up with a few injured fans, a lot of shocked looks, and a million and one gifs instead.</p><p>The singer was performing his trademark hit, "Adorn," in a dapper all-white suit when he attempted to run and jump from one section of the stage to another, leaping over a pit full of fans. He miscalculated his reach, however, and landed just short of the stage, kicking one fan in the face and landing on another's arm.</p><p>Footage from the incident shows the first fan immediately falling to the floor as a bewildered Miguel continued with his performance sitting down on the stage, though he reached back several times to make sure the fan was okay. The surrounding audience members looked on with a mixture of confusion and awe.</p><p>"Got caught up in the moment, thank goodness Khyati is okay," he <a href=#>later tweeted</a>, adding several hours later: "Rock and roll made me do it."</p><p>The fan later showed up backstage with the superstar immediately after the incident and was all smiles as Miguel <a href=#>admitted that he'd miscalculated</a> the jump.</p><p>"Well, I think it's kind of clear what happened," he told Billboard's editorial director Bill Werde. "But I'm very happy to bring my new friend, Khyati, we just met. Unfortunately we did not meet under the best circumstances, but I think we're okay."&nbsp;</p><p>"The crazy thing is, when you're performing and you're just kind of into it, you never know where it's gonna go and where you're gonna go with it, and how that might turn out," he continued. "So this is one of the less favorable moments."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Khyati, who held an ice pack to her arm, said that the dramatic end of the performance didn't change her opinion of the singer.</p><p>"I Adorn him," she said with a smile.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamoZeqsq15yqKapKtdm66vecinZK2glWKzoq%2FEZpitZZKeua2uzpqpnWWdqsCqr4yarpqqlKh6c3yQbGlpbV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
