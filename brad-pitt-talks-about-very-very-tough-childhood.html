[My father] was really big on integrity – and that informed a lot of what [we] try to do now. "Although he insists he had a very happy childhood the 51-year-old has said that he uses a different approach when it comes <a class=hm-link href=#>to disciplining his own children</a>. "I am [a disciplinarian] with the boys. Girls do no wrong so I don’t have to be. I feel like my job is to show them around, help them find what they want to do with their life, put as many things in front of them, and pull them back when they get out of line, so they know who they are."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/20f6766ed3da-brad-children-a.jpg><p id=eYxRs8GEph5h data-wc=11><strong>Brad says he is disciplining his children in his own way</strong></p><p id=e55_qBwwOjSU data-wc=81>Although Brad now considers himself an atheist, his other half Angelina has often opened up about her belief in a higher power. Speaking with People Magazine the 40-year-old said: "When there is an obstacle, you have to rise to the challenge, not be overwhelmed by it. And we’re not alone in the world. I don’t know if there’s a name for that – religion or faith – just that there’s something greater than all of us and it’s uniting and beautiful."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQbmhqamhnhXWFmGiZq5mUYr2qwNNmq5qkm6h6oq7OrqtmrpWnxm7CxKuwZqyfqrSpecKhoKWcmKS8pXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
