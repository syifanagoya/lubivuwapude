That is a combined net worth with her husband since 1997, director/producer Judd Apatow.</p><p>She emerged in the Hollywood scene with her breakout role in "The Cable Guy" (1996), where she starred alongside <a href=# title="Jim Carrey Net Worth">Jim Carrey</a>. However, it was her performances in several of her husband Judd Apatow's films, that catapulted her into the limelight. In "Knocked Up" (2007) and its spin-off "This Is 40" (2012), Mann showcased her ability to convey depth and vulnerability while keeping the audience chuckling with her character's all-too-relatable life dilemmas. Her portrayals in these films expertly mixed humor with poignant moments, navigating the complexities of relationships and motherhood with a refreshingly authentic approach.</p><p>Mann's capabilities aren't restricted to one particular genre.

Furthermore, her role in "The Other Woman" (2014) combined comedic prowess with elements of a classic revenge tale, showcasing her adaptability as an actress.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Leslie Jean Mann was born on March 26th of 1972 in San Francisco, California. Raised alongside two siblings in Newport Beach by a successful businesswoman, Leslie was quite shy as a child. After graduating from high school, Leslie began her acting journey at Joanne Baron / D.W. Brown Acting Studio. During this period, she linked up with an improvisational comedy improv troupe called "The Groundlings." Although she initially attempted to gain a communications degree at college, she dropped out in favor of a professional acting career.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-208078 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/mann.jpg alt="Leslie Mann Net Worth" width=594 height=423 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-208078 class=wp-caption-text>Michael Loccisano/Getty Images</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Leslie Mann's acting career began when she was 18.

Mann then broke through with a memorable performance in the film "The Cable Guy" alongside <a href=# title="Ben Stiller Net Worth">Ben Stiller</a>, <a href=# title="Matthew Broderick Net Worth">Matthew Broderick</a>, and Jim Carrey. The film left critics scratching their heads, but it performed strongly at the box office with earnings of over $102 million. It also became a cult classic in later years.</p><p>After making a name for herself in the film world, Mann focused next on establishing herself in the television industry with "Freaks & Geeks." A year earlier, she had met her future husband Judd Apatow for the first time. "Freaks & Geeks" was a major hit with critics, but it was canceled after a relatively short run. Leslie's next major project was the 1997 film "George of the Jungle" alongside <a href=# title="Brendan Fraser Net Worth">Brendan Fraser</a>.</p><p>In 1999, Mann collaborated with <a href=# title="Adam Sandler Net Worth">Adam Sandler</a> in the film "Big Daddy."

In 2009, she proved her comedic instincts once again after a performance in the Adam Sandler movie "Funny People." The film was considered by many to be one of the year's best films.</p><p>After following up with the successful comedy "17 Again," Mann appeared in the independent film "I Love You Phillip Morris." The star-studded cast included Jim Carrey and <a href=# title="Ewan McGregor Net Worth">Ewan McGregor</a> and premiered at the Sundance Film Festival to widespread critical acclaim.

The couple married in 1997, and they have had two children over the course of their relationship. Both of their daughters, Iris and <a href=#>Maude Apatow</a>, have become involved in the entertainment world as actors in films and commercials.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>Along with her husband, Leslie owns several multi-million-dollar properties across the United States.</p><p>The couple's first purchase came in 2003 when they acquired a 6,018-square-foot property in Pacific Palisades, a thoroughly chic and desirable neighborhood in Los Angeles. After paying $4.474 million for the residence, Apatow and Mann sold it in 2010 for $6.495 million.</p><p>Not long after, they purchased a smaller home in Beverly Hills for $1.656 million. Many assumed that this was an investment property.</p><p>In 2009, the couple acquired the home of Marty Adelstein's home, a well-known TV producer. They managed to purchase the property for $18.25 million despite its listed price of $20 million. After 14 years of ownership, in September 2023 the Apatows sold their Brentwood mansion for $27 million.</p><p>Also in 2009, Leslie and Judd apparently purchased a vacation home in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii for $4.9 million.</p><p>In 2013, Leslie and her husband purchased an extensive, 2,550-square-foot residence in Malibu for $10.825 million. The beach house was originally built in the 30s â€“ a great decade for architecture. Unfortunately, something just didn't quite sit right about the place with the couple, and in 2015 they had put it back on the market â€“ hoping to flip it for $12 million and generated a substantial profit. In 2013, it was also reported that Mann and Judd had acquired an empty lot in Santa Monica for $8.6 million. The assumption was that the power couple planned to create a custom house on the land.</p><p>In 2018, Judd and Mann acquired another separate residence in Santa Monica for $14.5 million. Featuring 8,000 square feet and two private elevators, the home represents the finest in Hollywood luxury. It was also once owned by the legendary actor <a href=# title="William Holden Net Worth">William Holden</a>. The finishing touch includes a private rooftop deck spanning 2,000 square feet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLmmv8uinGalkaO7brrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
