It is likely that in the early seasons of Lucky Dog Brandon made $10-20,000 per episode. In more recent seasons it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that he makes $50-70,000 per episode. There are around 20 episodes per season, which would work out to $1 â€“ $1.4 million per season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wK6roaeiqHyjvsCnm6imXaKwrrXLpZinZZ6awW7DzquroWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
