Harrison, meanwhile, added that she and Nichols had been dating for “a while” and joked that she and her then-boyfriend had “different time frames” for their timeline of their romance.</p><p>The pair didn’t publicly announce when they called it quits, but eagle-eyed social media users noticed that the Day After Tomorrow star <a href=#>last uploaded a photo</a> with Harrison in March 2020.</p><p>While things are heating up for the <a href=#>Hart of Dixie</a> alum and the “Wolves” performer behind the scenes of <a href=#>Yellowstone</a>, the hit series has made headlines as it prepares to return for its fifth season.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>New episodes of the western were scheduled to premiere this summer, but reports surfaced in February that <a href=#>there were delays amid rumors</a> that <a href=#><strong>Kevin Costner</strong></a> was holding up production.
