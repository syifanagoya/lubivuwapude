That’s my homie. I hope everything falls into place and that we can all grow and build our relationships with our family and God and come back together one day and be stronger and happier.”</p><p>She also spoke about how the scandal changed her life: “A lot of people can be around when things are good. But you don’t know who’s really around until things are bad.”</p><p>A source close to the sisters said that Khloe Kardashian is not all buying what Jordyn is selling.</p><p>The insider told Hollywood Life: “Khloe finds it hard to believe that Jordyn has no idea what she’s doing when it comes to using the scandal to promote her career, and especially when it comes to hanging out with the men in Khloe’s life. Khloe feels without a doubt that Jordyn is taking advantage of her for her own 15 minutes of fame on the heels of Khloe’s heartache.”&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B0lZkEdHrE8/</p><p>The person claimed that Khloe is not thrilled that “Every time Jordyn is featured in another magazine, especially one as big as&nbsp;Cosmopolitan, it’s hard for Khloe to ignore the fact that she is taking advantage of the situation that led to Khloe’s heartbreak. Khloe is in such a great place right now, she’s moved past the drama and is focused on raising&nbsp;True, on all her brands, and spending time with close friends and family. Khloe just wishes Jordyn would own the fact that she is profiting from the drama and keep it real.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B0uizgPl4v8/</p><p>An insider with ties to Jordyn said: “Jordyn would love nothing more than for her relationship with Kylie and with Khloe and with the whole family to be fixed, but so far they haven’t been open to her attempts to try and heal things so what else can she do? She isn’t going to just stop her life; she doesn’t deserve that.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Do you think the former friends will ever make peace?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebnbmwsYykmKuckai1qq3NZqCsZZ6kwW6u1LKgp59drLWiwIyjpqucqaN6uLvOnapmoaNiwKa4y6KloGWnnbKvecitZJynnZrAbsDOZqKypJmaequxzaecq2VjZYV6fpBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
