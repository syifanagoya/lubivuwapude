Middleton and her siblings, Pippa and James, studied at prestigious private schools. The Middleton family own an online party supply business called Party Pieces. That business had a $50 million valuation. Before she became the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate worked for the family business and was a part time accessories buyer for the fashion chain Jigsaw.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-258871 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-950374768.jpg alt width=900 height=622 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-258871 class=wp-caption-text>Chris Jackson/Getty Images</p><p>When Kate married Will, she instantly no longer had the need to spend much of her own money, because her living costs, along with her husband's and children's, are covered by the Duchy of Cornwall. The Duchy is managed by Prince Charles and was set up in the 14th&nbsp;century to provide income to the royal family. The money from the Duchy covers Kate's travel wardrobe, housing, and household staff costs.</p><p>When Kate gave birth to Prince Louis in April, she stayed in a luxury suite at St. Mary's Hospital that cost $9,650 per day.</p><p>We put Kate's personal net worth, outside of her husband's wealth, at $10 million. Interestingly, just by existing, her children are also millionaires. By the time Princess Charlotte was one, she had a net worth of $4.6 million. <a href=# title="Prince George Net Worth">Prince George</a>'s net worth at the same age was about $3 million.</p><p>In the meantime, Party Pieces is selling wedding trinkets to mark the marriage of <a href=# title="Prince Harry Net Worth">Prince Harry</a> and <a href=# title="Meghan Markle Net Worth">Meghan Markle</a>.
